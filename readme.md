# Deep Learning in Legal Systems: Opportunities and Challenges

This repository contains the research and implementation for a thesis exploring the applications of deep learning in legal systems. The project focuses on developing AI-powered tools to assist with legal information retrieval and question answering, with a specific emphasis on Vietnamese legal texts.

Key features of this project include:

- Custom datasets of Vietnamese legal documents and Q&A pairs
- Experiments with various information retrieval techniques, including TF-IDF, BM25, and state-of-the-art embedding models
- Fine-tuning of the Instructor Embedding model for improved performance on Vietnamese legal text
- Exploration of methods to augment large language models with domain-specific legal knowledge

This work aims to contribute to the growing field of AI in law, addressing challenges specific to the Vietnamese legal system and language. The research demonstrates the potential of deep learning techniques to enhance legal research and accessibility of legal information, while also discussing important considerations around ethics, data privacy, and the limitations of current AI technologies in specialized domains.
